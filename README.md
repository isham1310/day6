📝 Contact Form with Client-Side Validation
About The Project
This is a solution for an internship task to build a responsive contact form with client-side validation. The project demonstrates core web development skills in form handling, dynamic user feedback, and input validation using JavaScript.

✨ Features
Responsive Design: The form is styled with Tailwind CSS to be clean, modern, and fully responsive across all devices.

Client-Side Validation: JavaScript is used to validate input fields for Name, Email, and Message.

Dynamic Error Messages: Specific error messages appear dynamically below each input field if validation fails.

Email Regex: The email input is validated using a regular expression to ensure a correct format.

Prevention of Submission: The form submission is prevented if any of the validation checks fail, utilizing event.preventDefault().

Success Message: A success message is displayed upon a valid submission.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the semantic structure and input fields for the form.

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): Used for all styling and layout, ensuring a clean and responsive user interface with utility-first classes.

JavaScript (ES6): Powers the client-side validation logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation for showing/hiding messages.
